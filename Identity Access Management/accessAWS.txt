How can users access AWS

There are 3 ways as to how we can access resources on AWS
1.) AWS Management console
2.) AWS Command Line interface -> protected by access keys
3.) AWS Software Developer KIT (SDK) -> protected by access keys

Access keys are generated through AWS console
Users are solely responsible for managing their access keys

AWS CLI:
A tool that enables you to interact with AWS Services using your command line shell using service commands
It allows direct public aps of AWS services
we can also run scripts to manage resources
It is viewed as an alternative to AWS Management console


AWS SDK
It is a language specific api (set of libraries)
this enables to access and manage AWS services programatically
