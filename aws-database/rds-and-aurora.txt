Amazon RDS (Relational databases)
Its a manages database for db and uses SQL as a query language
allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
eg: postgres,MySQL,MariaDB,Oracle,Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2,Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

Advantages:
1.) Automatic provisioning
2.) Continours backups and restore to specific timestamp
3.) Monitoring dashboards
4.) Read replicas for improving read performance
5.) multi AZ setup for disaster recovery
6.) Maintaince windows
7.) Scaling
8.) Storage is backed by EBS

Solution Architecure:
ELB -> EC2 instances <-> read/write -> database

Amazon Aurora: (Not Open Sourced)
It is a Proprietary technology from AWS
supported dbs: postgresSql and mysql
It is AWS Cloud optimised and claims 5xperfomance improvement over MySQL on RDS OVER 3X THE performance OF postgres ON RDS
It grows automatically in incremnets of 10gb up to 256TB
It is 20% more than rds but more effeciently.

Serverless:
Automated database instantiation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
No capacity planning is nneds
Least managaemnt overhead
Pay per second, can be more cost effective
good for infrequenctm intermittent or unpredictable
Shared storage volume

RDS Deployements: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ
1.) Read Replicas
Scale the read workload of the DB
Create upto 15 read replicas
Data is written on the main db

2.) mULTI-AZ
Failover in case of AZ outage (high availablility)
data is read and written in the main db
can only have one Failover

3.) Multi region:
Disaster recover in case of region issue
Local performance for Global reads
Replication cost
