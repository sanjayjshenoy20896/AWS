Each row is defined as a record.
SQL language is used to perform queries and lookups

NoSQL Databases:non relational databases

Benefits:
Flexibility: east to evolve data models
Scalability: designed to scale out by using distributed clusters
High-performance: optimised for a specific data model
Highly functional: types optimised for data model
eg: key-value,document,graph,in-memorymsearch Databases
Data is stored as a json document.

Database and shared responsibility model:
It offers to use manage databases
Benefits include:
1.) Quick provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
2.) Automated backup, upgradses
2.) OS PATching is handled by AWS
3.) Monitoring and altering

Note: many databases could be run on the EC2 but you must handle yourself the resiliency,backup,patching,high Availability, fault tolerance and scaling
