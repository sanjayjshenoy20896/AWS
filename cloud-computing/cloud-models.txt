Cloud models
They are three types of cloud service models
1.) SAAS (Software as a Service);
2.) PAAS (Platform as a Service);
3.) IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)


1.) Software as a service - SAAS
it gives you quick access to cloud based web applications
Vendor controls the entire computational stack, which can be accessed by the browser
eg: Google G Suite

2.) Platform as a Service
It is a platform that we can develop,test and organise different applications for your business.
it simplefies the process of Software development.
eg: Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

3.) Infrastructure as a Service
virtual provision of computational resources over the cloud.
It can provide you the entire range of Infrastructure such as storage,servers network alongside maintainance and support
eg: Amazon EC2 

Aws cloud models:

A.) Cloud-based deployment:
User has the fliexibility to migrate the existing resources to the cloud, design and build new applications within the cloud

B.) On-premise development:
Deploying resources in the premises using virtualisation and resource management tools does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing.

C.) Hybrid deployment:
The cloud deployment and on-premise development work together. This is ideal for legacy application to remain in on premise for maintainance and regulatory purpose.
