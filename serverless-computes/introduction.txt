Serverless computing:
You cannot see or access the underlying architecture.

Managed Services:
AWS handle infrastructure, patching, backups, and scaling, reducing your operational load for higher cost & less control.

unmanaged Services:
give you full control, customization, and responsibility for everything from OS to security, demanding more in-house expertise but offering flexibility and lower base cost.
