AWS lambda: Function as a service

A serverless compute service that runs on code without managing servers. 
Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers.
It automatically manages the underlying infrastructure based on scaling resources on volume of requests
It allows several programming languages on the fly.
You can optimize performance by configuring the appropriate memory size for your function.
The only limitation is that maximum duration of the code can be 15 mins.

How lambda works
1.) Upload code to lambda
2.) Set code to trigger from an event source
3.) Run code based on trigger
4.) Pay only for the compute time used

Use cases: ideal for building responsive, event-driven applications across a wide range of industries. 
1.) Real time image processing for a social media application
2.) Real time event handling for an game
3.) Personalised CDN for news aggregator
