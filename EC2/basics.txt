Amazon EC2:
It is one of the most popular of AWS offering
EC2 = Elastic Cloud Compute = Infrastructure as a Service
It mainly conssiste of 
1.) Renting Virtual machine (EC2)
2.) Storing data on virtual drives (Elastic Block Storage)
3.) Distributing load across machines (Elastic Load Balancer)
4.) Auto Scaling group
It is fundamental to understand how cloud works

EC2 Sizing and config options
Operating System (OS): Linux,Windows or Mac OS
How much compute power & Cores is needed
How much random-access memory needed
how much storage space (EFS & EBS) & (EC2 instance store)
Network speed: speed of the card,public IP Address
Firewall rules: security group
Bootstrap script (configure at first launch):EC2 User data

EC2 User Data:
It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
The script is only run at the instance first start
They include task as follows
1.) Installing updates
2.) Installing software
3.) Dommon commin files on internet
4.) Anything you can think of

The EC2 user data script runs with the root user

Shared responsibility model:
AWS
Infrastructure
Isolation
Replacing Faulty hardware
compliance validation

User
Security groups
OS -system patches and updates
Software util;ities
IAM ROLES ASSIGNED TO ec2 and IAM USER ACCESS MANAGEMENT


Summary:
1.) eEC2 instance: AMI(OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) +sTORAGE + sg +EC2 user data
2.) Security : Firewalls attched to ec2 instance
3.) EC2 user data: SCRIPT LAUNCHED AT START OF AN Instance
4.) ssh : Terminal access to EC2 instances (port 22)
5.) EC2 INSTANCE ROLE
6.) Purchase options
