EC2 Instance Types:
They are broadly classified into 7 Types
1.) General Purpose
2.) Compute Optimised
3.) Memory Optimised
4.) Accelerated Computing
5.) Storage Optimised
6.) Instance Features
7.) Measuring Instance Performance

Naming Convention
eg: m5.2xlarge
m:instance class
5: generation (AWS Improves them over time)
2xLarge: size within instance class


1.) General Purpose:
This is great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repos
They have a balance between computre.memory and Network
For leaning purpsoe, have used t2.micro general purpose EC2 Instance

2.) Compute Optimised
It is great for compute intensive tasks that require high Performance like batch processing, media transcoding,high perf web servers, high perf Computing, machine learning,gaming servers

3.) Memory Optimised
For workloads that process large datasers
Use cases:
High performance , relational/non-relational databases
distributes web scale cache stores
in-memory databases Optimised for BI (business intelligence)
real time processing of big unstructured data

4.) Storage Optinmised
Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high,sequnetial read and write access to large data sets on local storage
Use cases:
High freq online transaction
databases
Cache for in-memory databases
Data warehousing applications
Distributes file systems
