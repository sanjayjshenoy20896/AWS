Security Groups ( firewall to EC2 instances)
fundamental to network security of AWS
They control traffic is allowed into or out of our AWS instances
They only contain allow rules
They can reference by IP or scurity Groups
They regulate following
a.) Access to ports
b.) Authorised IP ranges - IPV4 AND IPV6
c.) Control of inbound network
d.) Control of outbound network
They are recognised as follows
a.) type (http/ssh)
b.) protocol (TCP)
c.) port ranges (80,22, OR custom tcp rule)
d.) source: address range
e.) description (text)

Good and important points to know
a.) Can be attched to multiple instances
b.) They are looked down to a region / vpc combination
c.)  They are outside the EC2 Instance
d.) Create a seperate group for ssh issue
e.) If there is timeout, then it is a security group issue
f.) If your application gives connection refused error, then its an application error and its not launched

by default all inbound traffic is blocked and all outbound traffic is Authorised
