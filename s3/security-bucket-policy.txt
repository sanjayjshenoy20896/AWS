Amazon S3 - Security bucket policy

1.) User - based 
IAM policies  -> Which api calls should be allowed for speicifc user from IAM

2.) Resource -based
Bucket policies -> Bucket wide rules form s3 console - allow cross account
OBJECT ACCESS CONTROL LIST (ACL) ->finer grain (can be disabled)
Bucket Access Control List (ACL) ->less common  (can be disabled)

Note:
an IAM principle can access s3 object if 
-> user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR resource policy ALLOWS it
-> There is no explicit deny

Encryption: Encrypt objects in S3 using encryption keys

Bucket Policy:
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Sid":"PublicRead",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principle":"*",
            "Action":[
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource":[
                "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
