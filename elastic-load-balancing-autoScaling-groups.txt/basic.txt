Scalability and high Availablility:
Scalability means application / system can handle greater loads by adapting

There are 2 kinds of Scalability
a.) Vertical Scalability
b.) Horizontal Scalability

It is linked but it is different to High Availablility

Vertical Scalability:
Increase the size of instance
eg:if instance runs on t2.micro 
scaling Vertically means running it on a t2.large
This is very common for non-distributed systems such as database
There is usually a hardware limit for scaling
Horizontal Scalability:
Increase the number of instances / systems for your application
It is used for distributed systems
Very common for web application or modern application
Here we use Auto Scaling group and Load balancer


High Availablility
It goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
it means running your instances / system in at least 2 Availablility zones
High Availablility to survive a data loss

Scalability vs Elasticty vs Agility
Scalability -> Ability to accommodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (Scale out)

Elasticty -> Once system is scalable, There is some autoscaling involved to scale resources up or down
This is cloud-friendly: pay-per-use demand,optimize costs

Agility: New IT resources are only a click away.
This means reduction in time to make those resources available to developers from weeks to just minutes.
