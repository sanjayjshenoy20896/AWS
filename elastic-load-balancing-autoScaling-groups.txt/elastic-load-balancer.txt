Load Balancer:
They are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers downstream.

WHY:
Spread load across multiple downstream instances
Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application.
Seemlessly handle failurs of downstream instances
Regular health checks
Provide SSL termination (https) for your websites
High Availablility across zones

Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?
It is a managed load balancer.
AWS guarantees that it will be working
AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance and high availability
AWS Provides only a few configuration knobs.

It costs luess to setup own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end.
