Auto Scaling Group:
The load pf website and applications can chnage from time to time.
In cloud, we can create and get rid of servers very quickly
The goal of an Auto Scaling group (ASG) is as follows:
1.) Scale out instances to match an increased load
2.) Scale in instances to match decreased load
3.) Ensure a maximum and minumum number of machines running
4.) Automatically register new instances to a load balancer.
5.) Replace new instances (deregister)

Cost savings: Only run at optimal capacty
Minimum Size -> min number of EC2 instances
Desired Capacity -> Number of instances to be added at a time
Maximum size -> maximum number of instances that application can have

Auto Scaling group in AWS with Load Balancer:
web traffic -> ELB -> EC2 instances

ASG - Scaling Strategies:
Manual scaling -> Update size of ASG manually
Dynamic Scaling:  Respond to chnaging demand
- Simple/ step Scaling
Cloud watch alarm is triggered (cpu>70) , then add 2 units
Cloud watch alarm is triggered ( CPU <30).remove2 units

- Target Tracking Scaling
eg: Want average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%

-Scheuled scaling
Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns

-Predictive scaling
Uses Machine learining to predict futrure scal;ing ahead of time
This is used for predictive load patterns
