Elastic File System (EFS):
Manages Network File System (NFS) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2.
it works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
Highly available ,scalable,expensive (3Xgp2),pay per use, no capacity planning

Difference between EBS vs EFS
EBS:
They are bound to a single availability Zone and cant be attched to another AZ
To switch to another availabilty zone, we  will need to create a snaphot of the EBS volume and restore it in a new AZ.
EFS:
They are shared by multiple ec2 instances on multiple AZ at the same time using EFS Mount Target.

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA):
Storage class is cost optimised for files not accessed every day
Upto 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
Once EFS-IA is enabled, it will automatically move files to EFS-IA based on last time they were accessed.
Enable with lifecycle Policy
It is transparent to the applications accessing EFS
