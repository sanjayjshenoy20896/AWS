Messaging and Queueing

In modern application development, reliability and resilience are important.
One effective way to achieve this is by adopting a service-oriented approach.

Based on above distinction, there are 2 types of architectures namely
1.) Monolithic architecture:
Applications consist of multiple components that work together to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running smoothly.
2.) Microservices architecture:
Application components are loosely coupled, meaning that if one component fails, the others continue to function normally. The communication between components remains intact, and the failure of a single component does not impact the entire system. 
This design promotes greater flexibility and reliability in the application.

Messaging and Queueing Services:

1.) EventBridge:
EventBridge is a serverless service that helps connect different parts of an application using events, helping to build scalable, event-driven systems.
EventBridge simplifies the process of receiving, filtering, transforming, and delivering events, so you can quickly build reliable applications.

2.) Amazon Simple Queueing Service (Amazon SQS):
It is a message queuing service that facilitates reliable communication between software components.
an application places messages into a queue, and a user or service retrieves the message, processes it, and then removes it from the queue.

3.) Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS):
Amazon SNS is a publish-subscribe service that publishers use to send messages to subscribers through SNS topics.
