Serverless:
It is a new paradigm in which developers dont have to manage servers any more
We just deploy code or function
It is commonly mentioned as a Function as a Service(FaaS)
It was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now includes anything thats managed databases, messaging and storage.
It does not need manging or provsioning
eg:S3,DynamoDB,Fargate,
